    <string name="about">This application is used for data collection of
        passive sensing of mental health study by
        UCLA ER (eHealth Research) Lab and MITRE.
        \n\nOur goals with this initial data collection effort
        are two-fold:
        \n\n
        1. To build a proof-of-concept technology
        platform capable of collecting, storing, and
        analyzing measures.
        \n
        2. Determining which metrics best correlate
        to which measures of mental health.</string>

    <string name="welcome">Welcome to eWellness app. This app will monitor your smartphone activity</string>

    <string name="consent_title">UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA \nLOS ANGELES (UCLA) \nSTUDY INFORMATION SHEET</string>
    <string name="consent_subtitle">Passive Sensing of Mental Wellness</string>
    <string name="consent_subtitle_p0">Dr. Majid Sarrafzadeh, from the Computer Science Department at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) is conducting a research study.
        \n\nYou were selected as a possible participant in this study because you are a current student, employee, or affiliate of the university.  Your participation in this research study is voluntary.</string>
    <string name="consent_t1">Why is this study being done?</string>
    <string name="consent_p1">This study aims to determine if data that can be collected passively off your phone,
        can be predictive of your mental wellness at a given time. This data is limited to embedded sensors like GPS, light, and accelerometer,
        and will not collect any personally identifiable information on you. Our eventual hope is to create a platform that can predict if a person
        is in crises and direct help to them without them needing to actively seek out help.</string>
    <string name="consent_t2">What will happen if I take part in this research study?</string>
    <string name="consent_p2">If you volunteer to participate in this study, the researcher will ask you to do the following:
        \n\n    ● Fill out a survey consisting of 24 multiple-choice questions once a week for the duration of the study
        \n      ● Fill out a small daily questionnaire of 10 multiple-choice questions.
        \n      ● Install the app and have it running on your phone in the background throughout the day.</string>
    <string name="consent_t3">How long will I be in the research study?</string>
    <string name="consent_p3">Participation will take a total of about 1 hour spread over the course of a month’s time.
        The only time requirements for the study will be installing the application, and taking the surveys.
        It is anticipated that the weekly survey will take no more than 5 minutes, and the daily survey no more than 1 minute. </string>
    <string name="consent_t4">Are there any potential risks or discomforts that I can expect from this study?</string>
    <string name="consent_p4">● Running a mobile application in the background may negatively impact the battery life and performance of the phone. We have taken steps to diminish the impact of the application, but some degradation is expected.
        \n● While the questionnaires are minimally intrusive, it is possible that probing your mental wellness state may engender some discomfort or unease. Please immediately discontinue the study if you feel the questioning to be discomforting.
        </string>
    <string name="consent_t5">Are there any potential benefits if I participate?</string>
    <string name="consent_p5">You may benefit from the study by becoming more aware of daily stressors and being more mindful of your mental state.
        \n\nThe results of the research may be included in future grant proposals or research publications. None of your specific data will be included in any public disclosure.
        </string>
    <string name="consent_t6">What other choices do I have if I choose not to participate?</string>
    <string name="consent_p6">As a student or university affiliate, your participation in this study will be entirely voluntary. Failure to complete or participate in the study will have no impact on your academic or employment status in the university. Conversely successful participation will not accord you any benefits beyond the explicit compensation mentioned below.
        </string>
    <string name="consent_t7">Will I be paid for participating?</string>
    <string name="consent_p7">You will receive an Amazon gift card for the successful participation in the survey. This will require your active participation throughout the data collection process. The precise amount offered will be dependent on the duration and consistency of involvement. Failure to remain actively engaged in the study may result in forfeiture of the gift card.</string>
    <string name="consent_t8">Will information about me and my participation be kept confidential?</string>
    <string name="consent_p8">Any information that is obtained in connection with this study and that can identify you will remain confidential. It will be disclosed only with your permission or as required by law. Confidentiality will be maintained by limiting collection solely to non-identifiable data. All collected data will be stored on a secure fully encrypted server, and will only be made available to research study investigators.
    \n\nThe researchers will do their best to make sure that your private information is kept confidential. Information about you will be handled as confidentially as possible, but participating in research may involve a loss of privacy and the potential for a breach in confidentiality. Study data will be physically and electronically secured. As with any use of electronic means to store data, there is a risk of breach of data security.
    \n\nNo identifiable information about you will be kept with the research data. All research data and records will be maintained in a secure location at UCLA. Only authorized individuals will have access to it. The research team, authorized UCLA personnel and regulatory agencies such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), may have access to study data and records to monitor the study. Research records provided to authorized,
        non-UCLA personnel will not contain identifiable information about you. Publications and/or presentations that result from this study will not identify you by name. The researchers intend to keep the research data and records indefinitely for future research.</string>
    <string name="consent_t9">What are my rights if I take part in this study?</string>
    <string name="consent_p9">● You can choose whether or not you want to be in this study, and you may withdraw your consent and discontinue participation at any time.
        \n      ● Whatever decision you make, there will be no penalty to you, and no loss of benefits to which you were otherwise entitled.
        \n      ● You may refuse to answer any questions that you do not want to answer and still remain in the study.
        </string>
    <string name="consent_t10">Who can I contact if I have questions about this study?</string>
    <string name="consent_p10">● <b>The research team:</b>

    <string name="notice_title">Mental Health Notice</string>
    <string name="notice_subtitle">A brief note on your mental health:</string>
    <string name="notice_p">Our daily survey will be prompting you for information on your mental well-being. This will include
        some specific prompts around your feelings of depression and anxiety. Although this information
        is being recorded for the study, your responses will not be reviewed regularly by researchers.
        \n\nAs such, if you ever feel overwhelmed, or that you need help, please do expect us to detect this
        and act on your behalf, but instead reach out to the appropriate resource. We’ve included a
        ‘Need Help?’ tab in the menu with contact info for a variety of UCLA and community resources
        available to you.</string>
    
    <string name="collect_title">Data Collection Permission</string>
    <string name="collect_p1">We’re about to ask you to allow a bunch of intrusive permissions for our app, so before we do, we wanted to explain precisely what information we will be collecting and how it will be used.
        \n\nFirstly, please note that we will <b>NOT</b> be collecting any personally identifiable information on you, including taking any photos videos, or recording any conversations.
        \n\nOur application will also <b>NOT</b> conduct any activities other than collect sensor data and your survey responses.
        </string>
    <string name="collect_p2">So here is precisely what sensors we will be collecting and how it will be used:
        \n\n●Application use: We’ll monitor the frequency and duration of use of specific phone apps.
        \n\n●Communication: We’ll monitor a log of incoming and outgoing phone calls and text messages, including the number of texts and phone calls and unique individuals contacted. We won’t be storing specific contact info, just the quantity and diversity of social interactions. This does <b>NOT</b> assess or record the content of communications.
        \n\n●Location: location using GPS, network and wifi detection.
        \n\n●Ambient sound detection: We will detect when your external environment is louder than 50 decibels using the phone’s microphone. We will only record decibel levels and NOT record any audio
        \n\n●Activity and movements: we will use the accelerometer, gyroscope, and GPS tracking to try and determine activity-types
        \n\n●Light: We will use the camera’s light sensor to detect light level associated with being outside or in a dark location. Video will <b>NOT</b> be collected
        \n\n●Phone use: We will monitor phone screen on-time
        \n\nIf you have any concerns about the data being collected please let us know. You will have to allow all permissions in order for the application to work properly.
