    <string name="consent_title">DEPARTMENT OF VETERAN AFFAIRS\nGREATER LOS ANGELES \nSTUDY INFORMATION INTRODUCTION</string>
    <string name="consent_subtitle">Pilot Study of Mobile Sensing Data to Evaluate Mental Health Status</string>
    <string name="consent_subtitle_p0">You are being invited to take part in a research study at the VA Greater Los Angeles Healthcare
System under the direction of Dr. Alexander Young and his research team. Before you decide to take
part, it is important for you to know why the research is being done and what it will involve. This
includes any potential risks to you, as well as any potential benefits to you and/or to the future
population of individuals you represent.</string>
    <string name="consent_p1">Read the information on the Research Consent form you have been provided closely, and discuss it with family and friends if you wish. Ask one of the
study staff if there is anything that is not clear or if you would like more details. Take your time to
decide. If you do decide to take part, your signature on this consent form will show that you received all
of the information below, and that you were able to discuss any questions and concerns you had with a
member of the study team. \nYour participation in this study is voluntary. If you don’t take part, you can still receive all usual care that
is available to you. Your decision not to take part will not affect the relationship you have with your
doctor or other staff, and it will not affect the usual care that you receive as a patient. If you decide to
take part, you may still withdraw at any time. If you do not wish to be in this study or leave the study
early, you will not lose any benefits to which you are entitled.</string>
    <string name="consent_t2">BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE</string>
    <string name="consent_p2">The purpose of this project is to study a mobile phone-based sensing platform (a mobile application or
“app”) that might be able to detect some mental health trends or stress. The application collects
information from your mobile phone and transmits it to the research team. Such information could help
improve mental health assessment and care in the future. This project will study the platform to see
how useful it is in detecting mental health problems. /nYou are being asked to participate because youare an adult with a serious mental illness (a diagnosis of bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or recurrent major depression with psychosis) who owns a phone running Android OS and you are currently receiving care at this facility.
/n About 30 people will take part in this study at VA Greater Los Angeles Healthcare System. Your participation in this research study is voluntary.</string>
    <string name="consent_t3">DURATION OF THE RESEARCH</string>
    <string name="consent_p3">Your participation in the project will last about 1 month.</string>

    <string name="notice_title">Mental Health Notice</string>
    <string name="notice_subtitle">A brief note on your mental health:</string>
    <string name="notice_p">Our study will be prompting you for information on your mental well-being. This will include
        some specific prompts around your feelings of depression and anxiety. Although this information
        is being recorded for the study, your responses will not be reviewed regularly by researchers.
        \n\nAs such, if you ever feel overwhelmed, or that you need help, please do not expect us to detect this
        and act on your behalf, but instead reach out to an appropriate caregiver. We’ve included a
        ‘Need Help?’ tab in the menu with contact info for a variety of clinical and community resources that are also
        available to you.</string>
    
    <string name="collect_title">Data Collection Permission</string>
    <string name="collect_p1">We’re about to ask you to allow a bunch of intrusive permissions for our app, so before we do, we wanted to explain precisely what information we will be collecting and how it will be used.
        \n\nFirstly, please note that we will <b>NOT</b> be collecting any personally identifiable information on you, including taking any photos videos, or recording any conversations.
        \n\nOur application will also <b>NOT</b> conduct any activities other than collect sensor data and your survey responses.
        </string>
    <string name="collect_p2">So here is precisely what sensors we will be collecting and how it will be used:
        \n\n● Application use: We’ll monitor the frequency and duration of use of specific phone apps.
        \n\n● Communication: We’ll monitor a log of incoming and outgoing phone calls and text messages, including the number of texts and phone calls and unique individuals contacted. We won’t be storing specific contact info, just the quantity and diversity of social interactions. This does <b>NOT</b> assess or record the content of communications.
        \n\n● Location: location using GPS, network and wifi detection.
        \n\n● Ambient sound detection: We will detect when your external environment is louder than 50 decibels using the phone’s microphone. We will only record decibel levels and NOT record any audio
        \n\n● Activity and movements: we will use the accelerometer, gyroscope, and GPS tracking to try and determine activity-types
        \n\n● Light: We will use the camera’s light sensor to detect light level associated with being outside or in a dark location. Video will <b>NOT</b> be collected
        \n\n● Phone use: We will monitor phone screen on-time
        \n\nIf you have any concerns about the data being collected please let us know. You will have to allow all permissions in order for the application to work properly.

//UCLA Pilot Specific Text
    <string name="consent_title">UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA \nLOS ANGELES (UCLA) \nSTUDY INFORMATION SHEET</string>
    <string name="consent_subtitle">Passive Sensing of Mental Wellness</string>
    <string name="consent_subtitle_p0">Dr. Majid Sarrafzadeh, from the Computer Science Department at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) is conducting a research study.
        \n\nYou were selected as a possible participant in this study because you are a current student, employee, or affiliate of the university.  Your participation in this research study is voluntary.</string>
    <string name="consent_t1">Why is this study being done?</string>
    <string name="consent_p1">This study aims to determine if data that can be collected passively off your phone,
        can be predictive of your mental wellness at a given time. This data is limited to embedded sensors like GPS, light, and accelerometer,
        and will not collect any personally identifiable information on you. Our eventual hope is to create a platform that can predict if a person
        is in crises and direct help to them without them needing to actively seek out help.</string>
    <string name="consent_t2">What will happen if I take part in this research study?</string>
    <string name="consent_p2">If you volunteer to participate in this study, the researcher will ask you to do the following:
        \n\n    ● Complete a once-weekly phone questionnaire
        \n      ● Fill out a questionnaire at the conclusion of the study
        \n      ● Install the app and have it running on your phone in the background throughout the day.</string>
    <string name="consent_t3">How long will I be in the research study?</string>
    <string name="consent_p3">Participation will take a total of about 1 hour spread over the course of a month’s time.
        The only time requirements for the study will be installing the application, and taking the surveys.
        It is anticipated that the weekly survey will take no more than 5 minutes, and the daily survey no more than 1 minute. </string>
    <string name="consent_t4">Are there any potential risks or discomforts that I can expect from this study?</string>
    <string name="consent_p4">● Running a mobile application in the background may negatively impact the battery life and performance of the phone. We have taken steps to diminish the impact of the application, but some degradation is expected.
        \n● While the questionnaires are minimally intrusive, it is possible that probing your mental wellness state may engender some discomfort or unease. Please immediately discontinue the study if you feel the questioning to be discomforting.
        </string>
    <string name="consent_t5">Are there any potential benefits if I participate?</string>
    <string name="consent_p5">You may benefit from the study by becoming more aware of daily stressors and being more mindful of your mental state.
        \n\nThe results of the research may be included in future grant proposals or research publications. None of your specific data will be included in any public disclosure.
        </string>
    <string name="consent_t6">What other choices do I have if I choose not to participate?</string>
    <string name="consent_p6">As a student or university affiliate, your participation in this study will be entirely voluntary.
