    <string name="about">This application is used for data collection of
        passive sensing of mental health study by
        UCLA ER (eHealth Research) Lab and MITRE.
        \n\nOur goals with this initial data collection effort
        are two-fold:
        \n\n
        1. To build a proof-of-concept technology
        platform capable of collecting, storing, and
        analyzing measures.
        \n
        2. Determining which metrics best correlate
        to which measures of mental health.</string>

    <string name="consent_title">UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA \nLOS ANGELES \nSTUDY INFORMATION SHEET</string>
    <string name="consent"> <b>Passive Sensing of Mental Wellness</b>
        \n\nDr. Majid Sarrafzadeh, from the Computer Science Department at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) is conducting a research study.
        \n\nYou were selected as a possible participant in this study because you are a current student, employee, or affiliate of the university.  Your participation in this research study is voluntary.
        \n\n<b>Why is this study being done?</b>
        \n\nThis study aims to determine if data that can be collected passively off your phone, can be predictive of your mental wellness at a given time. This data is limited to embedded sensors like GPS, light, and accelerometer, and will not collect any personally identifiable information on you. Our eventual hope is to create a platform that can predict if a person is in crises and direct help to them without them needing to actively seek out help.
        \n\n<b>What will happen if I take part in this research study?</b>
        \n\n    If you volunteer to participate in this study, the researcher will ask you to do the following:
        \n\n    ● Fill out a survey consisting of 24 multiple-choice questions once a week for the duration of the study
        \n      ● Fill out a small daily questionnaire of 10 multiple-choice questions.
        \n      ● Install the app and have it running on your phone in the background throughout the day.
        \n\n<b>How long will I be in the research study?</b>
        \n\nParticipation will take a total of about 1 hour spread over the course of a month’s time. The only time requirements for the study will be installing the application, and taking the surveys. It is anticipated that the weekly survey will take no more than 5 minutes, and the daily survey no more than 1 minute.
        \n\n<b>Are there any potential risks or discomforts that I can expect from this study?</b>
        \n\n    ● Running a mobile application in the background may negatively impact the battery life and performance of the phone. We have taken steps to diminish the impact of the application, but some degradation is expected.
        \n      ● While the questionnaires are minimally intrusive, it is possible that probing your mental wellness state may engender some discomfort or unease. Please immediately discontinue the study if you feel the quentionning to be discomforting.
        \n\n<b>Are there any potential benefits if I participate?</b>
        \n\nYou may benefit from the study by becoming more aware of daily stressors and being more mindful of your mental state.
        \n\nThe results of the research may be included in future grant proposals or research publications. None of your specific data will be included in any public disclosure.
        \n\n<b>What other choices do I have if I choose not to participate?</b>
        \n\nAs a student or university affiliate, your participation in this study will be entirely voluntary. Failure to complete or participate in the study will have no impact on your academic or employment status in the university. Conversely successful participation will not accord you any benefits beyond the explicit compensation mentioned below.
        \n\n<b>Will I be paid for participating?</b>
        \n\nYou will receive an Amazon gift card of $20 for the successful participation in the survey. This will require your active participation for the full month of data collection. Failure to remain actively engaged in the study may result in forfeiture of the gift card.
        \n\n<b>Will information about me and my participation be kept confidential?</b>
        \n\nAny information that is obtained in connection with this study and that can identify you will remain confidential. It will be disclosed only with your permission or as required by law. Confidentiality will be maintained by limiting collection solely to non-identifiable data. All collected data will be stored on a secure fully encrypted server, and will only be made available to research study investigators.
        \n\n<b>What are my rights if I take part in this study?</b>
        \n\n    ● You can choose whether or not you want to be in this study, and you may withdraw your consent and discontinue participation at any time.
        \n      ● Whatever decision you make, there will be no penalty to you, and no loss of benefits to which you were otherwise entitled.
        \n      ● You may refuse to answer any questions that you do not want to answer and still remain in the study.
        \n\n<b>Who can I contact if I have questions about this study?</b>
        \n\n    ● <b>The research team:</b>
        \n      If you have any questions, comments or concerns about the research, you can talk to the one of the researchers. Please contact:
